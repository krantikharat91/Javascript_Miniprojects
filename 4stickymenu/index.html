            Agriculture encompasses crop and livestock production, aquaculture, fisheries and forestry for food and non-food products.[1] Agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization, whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that enabled people to live in cities. While humans started gathering grains at least 105,000 years ago, nascent farmers only began planting them around 11,500 years ago. Sheep, goats, pigs and cattle were domesticated around 10,000 years ago. Plants were independently cultivated in at least 11 regions of the world. In the twentieth century, industrial agriculture based on large-scale monocultures came to dominate agricultural output.
            <br>

            Today, small farms produce about a third of the worldâ€™s food, but large farms are prevalent.[2] The largest one percent of farms in the world are greater than 50 hectares and operate more than 70 percent of the world's farmland.[2] Nearly 40 percent of agricultural land is found on farms larger than 1,000 hectares.[2] However, five of every six farms in the world consist of less than two hectares and take up only around 12 percent of all agricultural land.[2]
            <br>

            The major agricultural products can be broadly grouped into foods, fibers, fuels, and raw materials (such as rubber). Food classes include cereals (grains), vegetables, fruits, cooking oils, meat, milk, eggs, and fungi. Global agricultural production amounts to approximately 11 billion tonnes of food,[3] 32 million tonnes of natural fibres[4] and 4 billion m3 of wood.[5] However, around 14 percent of the world's food is lost from production before reaching the retail level.[6]
            <br>

            Modern agronomy, plant breeding, agrochemicals such as pesticides and fertilizers, and technological developments have sharply increased crop yields, but also contributed to ecological and environmental damage. Selective breeding and modern practices in animal husbandry have similarly increased the output of meat, but have raised concerns about animal welfare and environmental damage. Environmental issues include contributions to climate change, depletion of aquifers, deforestation, antibiotic resistance, and other agricultural pollution. Agriculture is both a cause of and sensitive to environmental degradation, such as biodiversity loss, desertification, soil degradation, and climate change, all of which can cause decreases in crop yield. Genetically modified organisms are widely used, although some countries ban them.
            <br>
            <h4>Introduction</h4>

            The term agriculture comes from the Latin word ager which means field and cultura that means cultivation. Agriculture basically involves the cultivation and production of crops and livestock products.

            History of Agriculture

            The history of agriculture dates back several centuries. It began in different parts of the world independently about 105,000 years back mostly by the collection of wild grains for the purpose of eating. Here is how different countries were involved in this activity:

            In Mesopotamia, pigs were domesticated around 15,000 years ago. They began domesticating sheep around 2000 years later.
            In China, rice was cultivated around 13,500 years ago. They eventually began cultivating soy, azuki beans and mung.
            In Turkey, cattle were domesticated around 10,500 years ago.
            Beans, potato, coca, llamas and alpacas were domesticated around 10,000 years ago.
            Sugarcane and certain root vegetables were cultivated in New Guinea around 9,000 years ago.
            Cotton was domesticated in Peru around 5,600 years ago.
            Similarly, the domestication of various plants and animals is being done in many other parts of the country since thousands of years.
            <br>
            <h4>Impact of Modern Technology on Agriculture</h4>

            The development in the field of science and technology led to the use of modern techniques in agriculture. While it has contributed a great deal to the development of the agriculture sector, the modern technology has also had certain negative repercussions on the sector. Here is the kind of impact it has had:
            <br>
            The use of fertilizers and pesticides as well as the use of technologically advanced equipments for the cultivation of crops has increased the yields drastically however it has also been the cause of ecological damage and impacted the human health negatively.
            Selective breeding and the use of other modern practices in the rearing of animals has increased the supply of meat however it has raised the concern about animal welfare.
            <br>
            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            Like every other sector, the agricultural sector has also evolved over the centuries and its development has brought about certain positive and negative repercussions to the society.
